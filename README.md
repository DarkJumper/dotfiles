# My Dofiles

## Important before execution

VScode should be installed beforehand.
Code should be mandatory added to path.

```
cat << EOF >> ~/.zprofile
# Add Visual Studio Code (code)
export PATH="\$PATH:/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin"
EOF
```

Otherwise no plugin will be installed and an error will be displayed during execution.
